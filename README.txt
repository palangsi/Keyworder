Description to Keyword Comma Spaced Utility for keywording

This is a simple, single-file web utility designed to help microstock contributors quickly convert a standard project description into a clean, comma-spaced list of keywords suitable for use as tags in platforms like GitHub, npm, or documentation systems.

🚀 How It Works

The tool performs three key actions:

Normalization: It takes any input string and replaces all instances of multiple spaces, newlines, and tabs with a single space.

Conversion: It replaces every single space ( ) in the normalized string with a comma and a single space (, ).

Copy: It automatically copies the resulting keyword string to your clipboard for instant pasting.
